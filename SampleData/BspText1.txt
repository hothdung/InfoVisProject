As ending of freedom of movement is central to the deal, some MPs have been calling for the government to publish the white paper for its post-Brexit immigration bill before next week’s meaningful vote.

The government has told those MPs this is not likely to happen. On Wednesday, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was “still his intention” to publish it this month – a choice of words opposition MPs met with groans and sighs.

Defending the delay, Javid told MPs: “It’s worth keeping in mind that this is the biggest change in our immigration system in four decades. It’s important that we take the time and we get it right.”

Javid also said freedom of movement would end, “deal or no deal” – in effect saying that while it was a key part of the deal, it was not strictly tied to what May was offering.

He also said MPs had been given glimpses of what the post-Brexit immigration system would look like.

The government is proposing a single immigration system that treats migrants from EU countries in the same way as those from non-EU countries. Highly skilled workers who want to live and work in Britain will be given priority.

However, the government says the ability of people from abroad to deliver services and student exchange programmes will form part of future trade agreements.
